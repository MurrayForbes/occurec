V) Implement horizontal flip for AVI format
V) Make the horizontal flip the default option
V) Remove the vertical flip option or implement a vertical flip for AAV format
V) Make a Beep when starting and stopping a recording
V) Implement NTP Server time synchronisation every 10 min
V) Test XviD recording. It has been reported that stopping the recording crashes AAVRec

EASY:

- "Rec" should not be enabled for "Integrating" cameras if "Lock" hasn't been pressed
- The integrated FrameId should increase gradually (by 1) when a new integrated frame is detected

HARDER:

- Implement x2 integration time recognition (using a different simultaneously tested algorithm such as testing if every second diff signature is very close to the one 2 frames ago)
- Implement Differential Coding Compression for AAV 8 bit format
- Ensure that the start/end timestamps are not overwritten in the process of stacking

OCR Implemntation:

V) Implement an AVI simulator (that plays an AVI file rather than AAV)
- Complete the OCR tuning using simulated videos
- Implement a 'live' OCR testing without crashing and with logging all errors
- Successfully run a live test for 24 hours without any errors
