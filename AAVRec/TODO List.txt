V) Implement horizontal flip for AVI format
V) Make the horizontal flip the default option
V) Remove the vertical flip option or implement a vertical flip for AAV format
V) Make a Beep when starting and stopping a recording
V) Implement NTP Server time synchronisation every 10 min
V) Test XviD recording. It has been reported that stopping the recording crashes AAVRec
V) "Rec" should not be enabled for "Integrating" cameras if "Lock" hasn't been pressed
V) Refactor the AAV native code and remove all unused 12 and 16 bit stuff

EASY:

- The integrated FrameId should increase gradually (by 1) when a new integrated frame is detected

HARDER:

- Implement x2 integration time recognition (using a different simultaneously tested algorithm such as testing if every second diff signature is very close to the one 2 frames ago)
- Implement Differential Coding Compression for AAV 8 bit format
- Ensure that the start/end timestamps are not overwritten in the process of stacking images. There will be a challenge to determine the start and end milliseconds position. May need the OCR fully working to solve this.

OCR Implemntation:

V) Implement an AVI simulator (that plays an AVI file rather than AAV)
- Complete the OCR tuning using simulated videos
- Implement the OCR in unmanaged code
- Implement a 'live' OCR testing without crashing and with logging of all errors
- Successfully run a live test for 24 hours without any errors
